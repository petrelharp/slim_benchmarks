BCH 11 July 2019:
This folder contains tests targeted at one specific point in the code, rather than aiming at being typical/useful complete SLiM models.  Some of them run under the eidos command-line tool instead of SLiM.  Each file has a suggested invocation at the top.  In general they have a scaling parameter that can be varied to see how multithreading affects runtime for smaller vs. larger tasks; typically there is a tradeoff involved in starting a thread team, such that tasks below a threshold size actually run slower on MP (but that threshold size will vary by platform).
